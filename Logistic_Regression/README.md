# Logistic Regression from Scratch

## Introduction
This project implements logistic regression from scratch using NumPy and Pandas. It does not use built-in machine learning libraries like scikit-learn but instead demonstrates the mathematical foundations of logistic regression, including gradient descent optimization.

## Features
- Loads dataset from CSV files
- Implements logistic regression using NumPy
- Uses gradient descent for optimization
- Visualizes decision boundaries

## Installation
To run this project, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/anianimesh905/ML_Project/tree/main/Logistic_Regression>
   cd <Logistic_Regression>
   ```
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Logistic_From_Scracth.ipynb
   ```

## Dataset
- `logisticX.csv`: Independent variables (features)
- `logisticY.csv`: Dependent variable (labels)
